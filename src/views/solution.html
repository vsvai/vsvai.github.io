            To generate electricity, solar panels need direct sunlight. Apart
            from things inside the panels like the type of glass and materials
            used, there are outside factors that also affect how much sunlight
            gets in. One of these factors is dirt and the power loss it causes,
            which is known as "Soiling loss."
            <br />
            <br />
            The dirt here means things like dirt and dust that collect on the
            solar panels. When these things build up, they stop sunlight from
            getting through to the panels. This makes the panels produce less
            electricity.<br /><br />
            This drop in power can last until someone cleans the panels, which
            might not happen right away. So, when panels get dirty, it means
            less money is made because less electricity is produced.<br /><br />
            This affects the people who own solar panels because they earn less
            money from the energy they make. <br /><br />That's why it's really
            important to know what causes dirt buildup and what makes it
            necessary to clean the panels regularly.
